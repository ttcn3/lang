# Unofficial TTCN-3 Source Repository Proof of Concept

TTCN-3 is a standard for testing and test specification that is actively
maintained by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

20 years of development have resulted in a number of documents that are
difficult to maintain, but also difficult to consume. Therefore a new major
release of the TTCN-3 standard is planned.

This repository is a proof of concept to demonstrate how a new way of working
could look like and how the upcoming major release of the TTCN-3 standard and
its deliverables could be managed sustainably.
